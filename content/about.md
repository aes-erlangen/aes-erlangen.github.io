Hello there! :wave:

We are the AES Student Section Erlangen-Nürnberg, a group of audio enthusiasts who love to share their passion for audio with others. We bring together people with diverse backgrounds and experiences, from the interested student to the experienced audio engineer or researcher. We organize events and workshops, invite audio professionals, and visit the AES convention (the largest audio conference in the world).

If you are interested in mixing, recording, audio technology, or audio research, come and join us - we are happy to get to know you! :smile:

## Mission statement of the AES:

> The Audio Engineering Society was formed with the purpose of uniting persons performing professional services in the audio engineering field and its allied arts, of collecting, collating and disseminating scientific knowledge in the field of audio engineering and its allied arts, of advancing such science in both theoretical and practical applications, of preparing, publishing and distributing literature and periodicals relative to the foregoing purposes and policies.

        My name is Komal, and I am pursuing a master's degree in Communication and Multimedia Engineering. As an audio enthusiast, I have a deep appreciation for sound, stemming from my school days learning Indian classical music. Currently, I am learning to play the ukulele and enjoy picking up new languages in my spare time. I am passionate about connecting with fellow audio engineering and music enthusiasts, always eager to exchange ideas and experiences.

    I am Mohammad, the Vice Chair (VC) of the AES Student Section Erlangen-Nuremberg. I am currently doing my Masters in Communication and Multimedia Engineering (CME). I am a very outgoing person eager to learn and try something new everyday. This eagerness combined with my interest in audio led me to join AES. I got more interested in audio during my studies as I took different audio related courses. What piqued my interest was how the human hearing works in general (when it comes to how we perceive sound and perform sound localization, for example). In my free time, I try to do a lot of sports like play badminton, table tennis and go for bouldering.

    Hi, my name is Ivana! As the secretary of the AES Student Section Erlangen, I support the organization of our activities and help to keep our members informed so that everything runs smoothly. My academic interests are centered around advancing speech processing technologies. Therefore, I am currently working on my master’s thesis at the AudioLabs, where I focus on employing deep learning models for sound event detection and speech extraction.

    Hey, I am Alex! I am currently studying electrical engineering at FAU with a focus on audio processing. Audio engineering allows me to combine my passion for music with my curiosity for technology. I play guitar, bass and drums and I am starting to explore music production with Ableton. I am looking forward to meeting new people that I can share my interests with.    </span>

    Hi, I am Aru. I am studying Information & Communication Technology Masters with Media Processing specialisation at FAU. I'm here because I love Signal Processing!!  I am fascinated with looking at problems from a multidimensional signals & systems perspective. I got interested in audio as a lot of DSP-related concepts are deeply linked to the audio signal processing. I have almost zero idea of music, but I am taking some courses related to music signal processing and trying to understand the math behind music signals. Apart from audio, I am interested in any kind of signal processing, e.g., image processing, computational neuroscience, etc. Especially, I am always up for discussions and listening to others experiences about wavelets, filterbanks, and possible collaboration between signal processing and physics. Hoping to meet more people enthusiastic about music, audio/signal processing, and get to know about their hobbies and interests (see, signal processing can be a door to meeting new friends!). Always happy to discuss about books (technical and story), movies, funny musical instruments, comics (super hero and non-super hero), sci-fi stuff (ok, I can't resist mentioning Doctor Who anymore), etc. Currently reading: Sync by Stephen Strogatz. My book suggestion to anyone any time: Totto Chan- The Little Girl at the Window by Tetsuko Kuroyanagi. See you at AES events!

    Hi, I’m Marc! I’ve been playing piano since I was 7, which sparked my lifelong passion for music. I completed my Bachelor’s in Electrical Audio Engineering and am currently pursuing a Master’s in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology (EEI). I’m fascinated by everything related to music, audio, and signal processing, and I’m excited to connect with others who share these interests!

    Hi, I am Carlotta! I am a PhD student at the International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, where I am working in the field of spatial audio. My research is all about how to recreate the perception of a spatial sound field most convincingly, either over loudspeakers or over headphones. 
As for audio-related hobbies, I used to play the trumpet, something that I should start again one day. Other than that, I love to travel, do all different kinds of sport and meet friends in my spare time.

    Hey, I am Anna! Luckily Anna is widely used in countries across the world because I love travelling, exploring new places and meeting new people. And let’s not forget about tasting new foods! For the last few years, I have been studying ICT at FAU and am about to graduate in April. I am passionate about the intersection of technology, design and humanities and have worked in various areas related to audio and speech processing. Whenever I don’t have the chance to travel abroad, I like to play classical guitar, read books and meet friends. My audio related projects for 2022 are building a loudspeaker by myself and learning about mixing to improve voice-overs and audio quality for video production.
If anyone likes to share tips or traveller stories, I am always up for a talk!

        I play clarinet (Bartok + learning some of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Duets-Complete-Including-Vol-I-II-III/dp/B001ANVT10">Bop duets</a> + scales atm) and sometimes piano (currently learning BWV 847). I'm dancing the Lindy Hop (also started with choreographies last week again :D) and doing a PhD at AudioLabs in distributed audio systems. I'm a member of the Rust Machine Learning group and like to tinker in functional programming and statistics. My favorite authors are Pratchett, Moers, Dragt and Gaiman and currently I'm reading a book by Clemens Setz. I also like to sail!

    I‘m Maryam and come from Iran. I study M.Sc of Communications and Multimedia Engineering at FAU. My passion for signal processing has led me to many experiences with its applications in biomedical and communications engineering areas and now, I‘m warmly welcoming audio and music processing! Currently, I have a student job at the AudioLabs in music processing field.
    In my free time, I go out for a walk at random places and enjoy a podcast, I learn German(!), read books and cook! Cats, coffee, singing and meeting new people are my non-signal processing passions! :D
    All in all, I do enjoy meeting and communicating with people, and putting a smile on your face! :)

        My enthusiasm for audio and passion for music brought me to pursue a Ph.D. in the field of music information retrieval at the International Audio Laboratories Erlangen. In my daily work, I conduct research on signal processing tools for analyzing multitrack recordings of polyphonic singing. In my free time, I play guitar and piano. Also, I like to play around with audio equipment and record my own songs. I am always happy to connect and meet new people.
